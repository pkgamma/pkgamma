Hi, my name is Philip. I am a software engineer with a passion for human-centered design. I design and develop intuitive products with great attention to detail.

I am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Previously, I worked at [Caterpillar](https://www.builtinchicago.org/company/cat-digital) and [DeepWalk Research](https://www.deepwalkresearch.com/). I also founded [PKGamma Digital Agency](http://pkgamma.com), organized a [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/), and helped put together [HackIllinois](https://hackillinois.org) and the [RP Tech Conference](https://reflectionsprojections.org). At school, I develop at [Hack4Impact](https://uiuc.hack4impact.org/) to empower non-profits that are doing meaningful work to communities.
